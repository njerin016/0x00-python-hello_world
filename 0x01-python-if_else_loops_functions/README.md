This directory has projects on if,else loops and functions.

0. 0-positive_or_negative.py - assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
1. 1-last_digit.py - assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
2. 2-print_alphabet.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. 3-print_alphabt.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. 4-print_hexa.py - a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
5. 5-print_comb2.py - a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. 6-print_comb3.py - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. 7-islower.py - a function that checks for lowercase character.

13. 13-insert_number.c, lists.h - a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
14. 100-print_tebahpla.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
15. 101-remove_char_at.py - a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
16. 102-magic_calculation.py - Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
